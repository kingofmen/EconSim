**Point**

The idea is to have a *curated* web, one which rests on human effort
and where Good Stuff will still be around in twenty years.

**Reputation System**

Idea is not super original: Set of certificates, "A vouches for B",
with public/private key signatures and persistent
identities. Difference: Set up protocol so one can vouch for multiple
things! "I know his identity", "is a real person", "has a PhD",
whatever. Can in principle be stored on the blockchain! But no actual
need.

**Curated lists**

Given a reputation system, a company can decide that identity X is its
root node, and it also trusts Y and Z; and if they vouch that A and B
have good taste in subject alpha, then all alpha-interested people
should check out their curated collections.

**Snapshots**

Also it would be helpful if we could store snapshots, stripping the
useless stuff and leaving only the actual HTML and images. CSS if you
must, I guess.
